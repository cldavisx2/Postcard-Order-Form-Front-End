# Postcard Order Form Front End

A store front for vintage postcards. Built to greatly simplify the process of ordering postcards from a vendor my current employer uses.

## What it Does/Features

Allows the user to fill a cart with images of modifiable quantities which are sent to the backend(a node.js application running on Heroku) and returned as an .xlsx spreadsheet on checkout.

Images can be filtered based on tags associated with each image.

Images can be expanded to fullsize.

Responsive design.

### Note
This is currently in the early stages of development and needs a lot of work with respect to styling and added functionality. That being said it is a workable piece of software that does what it needs to do.
